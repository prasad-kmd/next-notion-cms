You are an expert Next.js 16 developer. When generating, editing, or refactoring any code for this project, you MUST follow ALL of the rules below without exception. The goal is ZERO ESLint errors/warnings and ZERO GitHub CodeQL security warnings — not by suppressing them, but by writing correct code from the start. Only use suppression comments (`eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, etc.) as a last resort and only when explicitly told there is no fix available, and always add a comment explaining WHY it is suppressed.

# SECTION 1 — NEXT.JS 16 SPECIFICS

1.1  ROUTING & MIDDLEWARE
  - This project uses the App Router. Never use the Pages Router unless explicitly asked.
  - Middleware has been REPLACED by proxy.ts in Next.js 16.
    • Rename `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` and rename the exported function to `proxy`.
    • Never generate or suggest `middleware.ts` files.

1.2  CONFIGURATION (next.config.ts / next.config.js)
  - The `eslint` option inside next.config is REMOVED in Next.js 16. Never include it.
  - The `serverRuntimeConfig` and `publicRuntimeConfig` options are REMOVED.
    • Use environment variables (process.env) instead for all config values.
  - The `experimental.ppr` flag is REMOVED. Use Cache Components instead.
  - Do not reference any deprecated config fields.

1.3  LINTING (ESLint)
  - Next.js 16 removed `next lint`. Run ESLint directly via `eslint .` or via scripts.
  - next build no longer runs linting automatically. Set up ESLint in CI/scripts separately.
  - Always use ESLint Flat Config format (`eslint.config.mjs`), NOT the legacy `.eslintrc` format.
  - Use `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` and `eslint-config-next/typescript` together.
  - Use `defineConfig` from `'eslint/config'` for all ESLint configuration.
  - Ensure `globalIgnores` covers: `.next/**`, `out/**`, `build/**`, `next-env.d.ts`.

1.4  REACT COMPILER
  - The React Compiler is stable in Next.js 16. Do not write manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` optimizations unless there is a specific, documented reason.
  - Do not add redundant memoization that the compiler already handles.

1.5  CACHING & DATA FETCHING
  - Use the new Cache Components model with `use cache` for instant navigation.
  - Do not use the old `fetch()` caching options (e.g., `cache: 'force-cache'`) unless the project specifically targets older Next.js compatibility.

1.6  TURBOPACK
  - Turbopack is the default bundler. Do not add webpack-specific config unless required.

# SECTION 2 — ESLINT: REACT & REACT HOOKS

2.1  HOOKS RULES (react-hooks/*)
  - ALWAYS follow the Rules of Hooks: only call hooks at the top level of a React function component or custom hook. Never call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
  - Always include ALL variables used inside a `useEffect`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo` in the dependency array. Never omit dependencies or use a stale closure.
  - If a dependency causes an infinite loop, restructure the logic (e.g., `useRef`, moving the value outside the component, or using a callback ref) — do NOT suppress the exhaustive-deps rule.

2.2  JSX RULES
  - Never use unescaped HTML entities in JSX (e.g., use `&apos;` instead of `'`, `&amp;` instead of `&`, `&quot;` instead of `"`). (react/no-unescaped-entities)
  - Always provide a unique, stable `key` prop for every element in a `.map()` or list render. Never use array index as a key unless the list is static and never reordered.
  - Never use `<img>` directly. Always use the Next.js `<Image />` component from `'next/image'` with required width, height (or fill), and alt props.
  - Never use `<a>` tags for internal navigation. Always use Next.js `<Link />` from `'next/link'`.
  - Always add a meaningful, descriptive `alt` attribute to every `<Image />` or `<img>` element. Empty `alt=""` is only acceptable for decorative images.

2.3  COMPONENT STRUCTURE
  - Always define components as named function declarations or named arrow function constants — never as anonymous default exports.
    BAD:  `export default function() { ... }`
    GOOD: `export default function MyComponent() { ... }`
  - Every component file must export only one default component (avoid multiple exports causing confusion).
  - Do not define components inside other components. Always hoist them to the module level.

2.4  PROP TYPES / TYPESCRIPT
  - This project is TypeScript-first. Never use PropTypes. Always type props with TypeScript interfaces or types.
  - Never use `any` type. Use `unknown` if the type is truly not known, then narrow it with type guards.
  - Never use non-null assertions (!) unless you have explicitly verified the value cannot be null/undefined, and add a comment explaining why.
  - Always type all function parameters and return values explicitly where inference is not obvious.

# SECTION 3 — ESLINT: TYPESCRIPT

3.1  ASYNC / PROMISES
  - Always await Promises that return values that are used. Never ignore a returned Promise silently. (no-floating-promises)
  - Always handle errors in async functions with `try/catch` or `.catch()`.
  - Never use async without await inside the function body.
  - For Server Actions and API route handlers, always handle and return typed error responses.

3.2  TYPE SAFETY
  - Never use `as any` or `as unknown as SomeType` as a shortcut. Fix the underlying type issue properly.
  - Never use `@ts-ignore`. Use `@ts-expect-error` only if truly necessary, with a comment explaining the reason.
  - Avoid type assertions (`as`) where TypeScript can infer correctly.
  - Always use `satisfies` operator when validating object shapes against a type without widening it.
  - Use strict null checks. Never assume a value is defined without checking.

3.3  IMPORTS
  - Always use named imports over namespace imports where possible.
  - Never import types at runtime — use `import type` for type-only imports.
  - Remove all unused imports immediately. Never leave dead imports.
  - Use path aliases (e.g., `@/components`) consistently; never use deep relative paths like `../../../components`.

# SECTION 4 — ESLINT: GENERAL CODE QUALITY

4.1  VARIABLES & SCOPE
  - Never use `var`. Always use `const` or `let`.
  - Prefer `const` over `let` whenever the value is not reassigned.
  - Never declare variables that are not used. Remove all unused variables, parameters, and imports.
  - Never shadow outer scope variables with inner scope variables of the same name.

4.2  CONTROL FLOW
  - Never use `else` after a `return` statement (no-else-return).
  - Avoid unnecessary ternary expressions. Simplify to direct boolean returns where possible.
  - Always use `===` and `!==` (strict equality). Never use `==` or `!=`.
  - Never use `eval()` or `new Function()` — these are both a lint error and a CodeQL security violation.

4.3  OBJECTS & ARRAYS
  - Always use object destructuring for accessing multiple properties.
  - Always use array destructuring for useState and similar patterns.
  - Use spread operators for shallow cloning instead of `Object.assign()` where appropriate.
  - Never mutate state directly. Always return new references from reducers and state updates.

4.4  CONSOLE & DEBUGGING
  - Never leave `console.log` in production code. Use `console.error` or `console.warn` only for legitimate error handling in catch blocks.
  - Never commit TODO/FIXME comments that reference broken or incomplete logic unless a corresponding issue exists.
  - Never leave debugger statements in any code.

# SECTION 5 — GITHUB CODEQL SECURITY RULES

These rules directly map to CodeQL query IDs. Violating them will produce security alerts in GitHub Code Scanning.

5.1  XSS — CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (js/xss, js/xss-through-dom)
  - NEVER use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. If it is absolutely required (e.g., for a CMS-rendered HTML block), ALWAYS sanitize the input with a trusted library (e.g., `DOMPurify`) BEFORE passing it, and add a comment explaining why.
  - Never insert raw user-supplied input into the DOM via `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `document.write()`, or `insertAdjacentHTML()`.
  - Never construct HTML strings from user input and inject them into the DOM.
  - Always encode/escape user-controlled data before rendering it in any context (HTML, JS, URL, CSS).
  - Always use React's JSX rendering (which escapes by default) rather than manual DOM manipulation for dynamic content.

5.2  SQL / NoSQL INJECTION (js/sql-injection)
  - Never concatenate or interpolate user-supplied input directly into query strings.
  - Always use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or ORM methods that handle escaping automatically.
  - Validate and sanitize all external input before using it in any query.

5.3  PATH INJECTION / TRAVERSAL (js/path-injection)
  - Never use user-supplied input directly in file system paths (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`, `path.join`, etc.).
  - Always validate and sanitize file paths. Use `path.resolve()` and then verify the resolved path starts with the expected base directory.
  - Never expose internal file paths in API responses or error messages.

5.4  SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY — SSRF (js/request-forgery)
  - Never use user-supplied URLs or hostnames directly in `server-side fetch()`, `axios()`, `http.request()`, or similar HTTP client calls.
  - Always validate URLs against an allowlist of permitted domains/hosts before making server-side requests.
  - Never forward raw query parameters as redirect targets without validation.

5.5  CORS (js/cors-permissive-configuration) [NOW IN DEFAULT SUITE]
  - Never set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on API routes that handle authenticated or sensitive data.
  - Always define an explicit, minimal allowlist of trusted origins for CORS.
  - In Next.js API routes and Route Handlers, always validate the Origin header against an allowlist before responding with CORS headers.

5.6  REMOTE PROPERTY INJECTION (js/remote-property-injection)
  - Never use user-controlled input as a dynamic property key to access or assign object properties (e.g., `obj[userInput]`).
  - Validate and restrict dynamic property access to a known, static allowlist.
  - Be especially careful with `Object.keys()`, `Object.entries()`, or enumeration patterns driven by user input.

5.7  CODE INJECTION (js/code-injection)
  - Never use `eval()`, `setTimeout(string)`, `setInterval(string)`, or `new Function(string)` with any user-controlled data.
  - Never dynamically `require()` or `import()` modules using user-supplied paths.

5.8  SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE
  - Never log, expose in API responses, or include in client-side bundles: passwords, API keys, tokens, secrets, PII, database connection strings.
  - Always use environment variables for secrets and access them only server-side (never prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` unless the value is safe to expose publicly).
  - Never put secrets in `next.config.ts` env block that would be bundled client-side.

5.9  OPEN REDIRECT (js/unvalidated-url-redirection)
  - Never use user-supplied input as the target of a redirect (`redirect()`, `router.push()`, `res.redirect()`) without validating it against an allowlist.
  - Always check that redirect targets are relative paths or belong to a trusted domain.

5.10 PROTOTYPE POLLUTION
  - Never merge or assign user-supplied objects directly onto plain objects using `Object.assign({}, userInput)` or spread without sanitization.
  - Reject input keys like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.
  - Use `Object.create(null)` for lookup tables that must not inherit prototype.

5.11 CRYPTOGRAPHY (js/weak-cryptographic-algorithm)
  - Never use `MD5`, `SHA1`, `DES`, `RC4`, or other broken/weak algorithms for security-sensitive operations (password hashing, tokens, signatures).
  - Always use `bcrypt`, `argon2`, or `scrypt` for password hashing.
  - Use `crypto.randomBytes()` or `crypto.getRandomValues()` for random values that require security — never `Math.random()`.
  - Always use HTTPS for all external API calls.

5.12 REGEX DoS — ReDoS (js/redos)
  - Avoid writing regular expressions with nested quantifiers on overlapping character classes (e.g., `(a+)+` or `(a|a)*`).
  - Prefer simple, linear regex patterns. For complex parsing, use a proper parser library.
  - Never run user-supplied regex patterns directly with `new RegExp(userInput)` without validation.

# SECTION 6 — NEXT.JS SPECIFIC LINT RULES
  (@next/next/* rules from eslint-plugin-next)

  - @next/next/no-html-link-for-pages: Never use `<a href="...">` for internal app pages. Always use `<Link href="...">`.
  - @next/next/no-img-element: Never use `<img>`. Always use `<Image />` from `next/image`.
  - @next/next/no-page-custom-font: Never load custom fonts via `<link>` in a page/component. Use `next/font` instead.
  - @next/next/no-sync-scripts: Never use synchronous `<script>` tags. Use `next/script` with an appropriate strategy.
  - @next/next/no-document-import-in-page: Never import from `next/document` outside of `pages/_document` (Pages Router) or the root layout.
  - @next/next/no-head-import-in-document: Never import `next/head` in `_document`.
  - @next/next/no-duplicate-head: Never include more than one `<Head>` per page.
  - @next/next/no-before-interactive-script-outside-document: Only use `next/script` with `strategy="beforeInteractive"` in the root layout.
  - @next/next/no-css-tags: Never use `<link rel="stylesheet">` manually. Import CSS files directly in components or use CSS Modules/Tailwind.
  - @next/next/no-unknown-component-props: Always pass valid, known props to Next.js built-in components.
  - Always use `next/font` (not `@font-face` in CSS or Google Fonts `<link>`) for font loading to comply with Core Web Vitals rules.

# SECTION 7 — ACCESSIBILITY (a11y)
  (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y rules)

  - Always add an `alt` attribute to `<Image />` and `<img>` elements.
  - Always associate `<label>` elements with their corresponding form controls using `htmlFor` or by wrapping.
  - Never use `onClick` on non-interactive elements (`div`, `span`) without also adding `role`, `tabIndex`, and `onKeyDown`/`onKeyPress` handlers.
  - Always use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) over generic `<div>`/`<span>`.
  - Never use positive `tabIndex` values (`tabIndex > 0`).
  - Always provide `aria-label` or visible text for icon-only buttons.
  - Never use `autoFocus` without a strong UX justification.
  - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA minimums.

# SECTION 8 — FILE, NAMING & STRUCTURE

  - Use PascalCase for component file names and component names.
  - Use camelCase for utility functions, hooks (useXxx), and variables.
  - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
  - Use kebab-case for route segment folder names inside the app/ directory.
  - Always place Server Components in the app/ directory by default.
  - Mark Client Components explicitly with `'use client'` at the top — only when they use browser APIs, React hooks, or event listeners.
  - Mark Server Actions explicitly with `'use server'`.
  - Never add `'use client'` to a file that does not need it — it unnecessarily increases client bundle size.
  - Co-locate component-specific types and interfaces in the same file, or in a dedicated types.ts file if shared across multiple files.

# SECTION 9 — SUPPRESSION POLICY (LAST RESORT)

  - NEVER suppress a warning just to make the lint run pass.
  - Only suppress after exhausting all fix options.
  - When suppression is absolutely required:
    • Use the narrowest possible scope (inline, not file-level).
    • ALWAYS add a comment directly above explaining WHY suppression is needed and what the known limitation is.
    • Prefer `eslint-disable-next-line` over `eslint-disable`.
    • NEVER use `@ts-ignore` — use `@ts-expect-error` with a reason comment instead.
  - Never suppress CodeQL security alerts via comments unless the specific finding is a confirmed false positive, and document this clearly.
